# 🔄 Unpivot Logic for Date Columns

## Problem
Attendance data used dates as column headers, which is not suitable
for time-series analysis.

## Solution
Used the **Unpivot Columns** feature to:
- Convert multiple date columns into a single Date column
- Retain attendance codes as values

## Outcome
The dataset became compatible with:
- Trend analysis
- Monthly aggregation
- DAX time intelligence
